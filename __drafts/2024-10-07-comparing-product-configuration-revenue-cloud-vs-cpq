# Introduction

Both **Salesforce CPQ** and **Revenue Cloud** offer powerful ways to configure products using rules, but while they share core concepts, the way they implement these rules varies significantly. In both systems, **Product Rules** are the foundation, built from conditions that trigger specific actions. This allows businesses to automate configuration, enforce dependencies, and prevent incompatible selections. However, if you're migrating from CPQ to Revenue Cloud—or working in both environments—understanding the nuances is crucial.

## How Dependencies and Exclusions are Managed

In Salesforce CPQ, dependencies or exclusions between products are typically managed using **Option Constraints**. These constraints are straightforward: they specify relationships between options, such as "Product A requires Product B" or "Product C excludes Product D." For example, if a customer selects a high-end warranty, it might automatically require that a premium version of the product be chosen.

Revenue Cloud handles these relationships in a similar manner, but instead of calling them Option Constraints, it leverages a system of **rules with actions** that either "Require" or "Exclude" specific products. This allows you to enforce similar dependencies and exclusions, though the terminology and structure may differ. The ability to impose logical constraints on configurations remains a critical feature in both systems, ensuring product compatibility and enforcing business logic at scale.

## Static vs Dynamic Rule Conditions: A Key Difference

Where the two systems start to diverge is in how they handle rule conditions. In CPQ, rule conditions can reference **dynamic values**, which are typically drawn from a combination of fields, attributes, or **summary variables**. This allows conditions to adapt based on real-time data. For example, a rule could be set to trigger only if the number of products added exceeds a certain dynamic threshold or if an attribute value, such as customer type or product version, meets a specific condition.

In Revenue Cloud, however, rule conditions are based on **static values**—this means the condition is predefined and doesn’t adjust based on real-time changes. But Revenue Cloud makes up for this limitation by providing a more abstract and flexible approach to condition testing. Conditions in Revenue Cloud are based on parameters defined in its **context service**, which acts as a central repository of data points that rules can reference. This abstraction layer gives Revenue Cloud more flexibility in the long run because it allows for a wide range of data to inform rule conditions, but it does require more upfront configuration and planning.

In practice, this difference means that Revenue Cloud may require additional setup to match CPQ's out-of-the-box capabilities, but it can ultimately handle more complex or nuanced configuration scenarios, especially if your organization deals with highly customizable products or services.

## Additional Rules for Product Availability

One feature that sets Revenue Cloud apart from CPQ is its ability to define **Qualification** and **Disqualification** rules. These rules go beyond simple product selection constraints—they directly govern whether a product is available for selection at all. 

For example, in Revenue Cloud, you could create a qualification rule that ensures a product is only available to customers in a certain geographic region or if a minimum order quantity is met. Similarly, a disqualification rule could prevent certain products from being available to customers who don't meet specific criteria, such as membership status or purchase history.

This is an area where Revenue Cloud provides functionality that doesn’t exist in Salesforce CPQ by default. In CPQ, product availability typically relies on **Price Book entries** or custom-built logic, whereas Revenue Cloud provides these qualification and disqualification capabilities as native features. This allows for more sophisticated control over what products can be offered in different sales contexts, helping businesses better manage availability based on evolving business rules.

## How to Prepare for a Migration or Implementation

If you're moving from CPQ to Revenue Cloud, one of the first steps is to audit your existing **Product Rules** in CPQ and identify any features that may not be supported directly in Revenue Cloud. This can be done manually, but using automation tools like **Prodly** can speed up the process by flagging unsupported rules for you.

After identifying unsupported features, determine if these are truly necessary for your product configuration. In many cases, what might seem like an essential feature could actually be an artifact of legacy setup. If the feature is indeed necessary, work with your implementation team to find an alternative way to achieve the same functionality in Revenue Cloud. This may involve leveraging Revenue Cloud's context service or building out custom rules that mimic CPQ's dynamic behaviors.

Finally, this migration offers a great opportunity to **reassess your overall product configuration design**. Revenue Cloud provides additional flexibility, especially when it comes to product availability and qualification. Take the time to ensure that your product rules are not only compatible but optimized for Revenue Cloud's capabilities.

## Conclusion

While both Salesforce CPQ and Revenue Cloud provide robust systems for configuring product rules, they differ in key areas such as rule conditions, availability controls, and configuration flexibility. Before migrating or implementing Revenue Cloud, it's essential to understand how these differences will impact your product setup and sales process.

With the right preparation and tools, moving from CPQ to Revenue Cloud can not only preserve your existing functionality but also enhance your product configuration capabilities, enabling greater control and flexibility in the long run.
