# Introduction

Migrating product attributes from **Salesforce CPQ** to **Revenue Lifecycle Management (RLM)** introduces both challenges and opportunities. While CPQ and RLM share common goals around product configuration, the underlying data models and attribute handling differ in important ways. In this post, we’ll break down the key differences and considerations when migrating product attributes between the two systems.

## Attribute Definitions: Metadata to Data

In **Salesforce CPQ**, attributes are typically stored as **custom fields** on the **Product** or **Product Option** objects. These fields define the attribute's name, type, and values, allowing them to be used during product configuration. In **RLM**, however, the attribute definition process is more sophisticated. Instead of custom fields, attributes are managed as **records** within the **Attribute Definition**, **Attribute Picklist**, and **Attribute Picklist Value** objects.

This fundamental difference means that migrating attributes requires translating **metadata** (fields) into **data** (records). While this step adds a layer of complexity, it offers more flexibility in the long run, as RLM’s attribute model can be extended and reused across different products more easily.

For instance, in CPQ, if a custom field on a product represents an attribute (like color or size), this field needs to be re-created as a **record** in RLM’s Attribute Definition. You'll also need to translate any picklist values associated with that attribute into corresponding records in the **Attribute Picklist** and **Attribute Picklist Value** objects.

## Migrating Configuration Attributes: API Names to IDs

In CPQ, the attributes used during product configuration are stored in the **Configuration Attribute** object, which maps directly to the **Product Attribute Definition**. This makes the migration process relatively straightforward. However, there is one key change: the **API name** of the custom field in CPQ must be replaced with the **ID** of the corresponding Attribute Definition record in RLM.

While this is largely a one-to-one mapping, it does mean that every reference to an attribute in your CPQ rules and processes will need to be updated with the new RLM record IDs. Automating this process can save time, but it's important to carefully verify each step to ensure nothing gets missed.

## Identifying Relevant Custom Fields and Product Rules

One potential pitfall in the migration process is that not every custom field on the **Product** or **Product Option** objects in CPQ is used as a product attribute. Before migrating, you’ll need to evaluate your **Product and Price Rules**—including **Product Condition**, **Price Condition**, **Price Action**, and **Summary Variable** objects—for any references to fields on the **Quote Line** object. These fields may have corresponding "twin" fields on the **Product** object that act as attributes during configuration.

This process of identifying relevant fields and mapping them correctly is essential for a successful migration. Fields used in rules but not recognized as attributes can cause errors or break configuration logic in RLM if not handled properly.

## Leveraging RLM’s Attribute Groups for Flexibility

One of the advantages of moving to RLM is the introduction of **Attribute Groups**. These allow you to define common sets of attributes that can be reused across multiple products. This is something Salesforce CPQ does not offer natively. For instance, if multiple products share the same set of attributes—such as size, color, or material—you can group these attributes in RLM, reducing redundancy and improving manageability.

While migrating attributes from CPQ to RLM can be automated to a large extent, it’s important to remember that automation typically only achieves a **"lowest common denominator" migration**. It handles the basics, but it won't take full advantage of RLM's more powerful data model features. To unlock RLM's full potential, I highly recommend manually reviewing and refactoring your product attributes as part of the migration process.

## Conclusion

Migrating product attributes from Salesforce CPQ to RLM involves more than just transferring data—it requires thoughtful consideration of how attributes are structured and used. By converting CPQ’s metadata-driven attributes into RLM’s record-based data model, you can take advantage of RLM’s more flexible approach, particularly with **Attribute Groups**.

While much of this process can be automated, you’ll want to review and refine your attributes manually to fully leverage RLM’s capabilities. This step is crucial if you want to move beyond basic migration and optimize your product catalog for the future.
