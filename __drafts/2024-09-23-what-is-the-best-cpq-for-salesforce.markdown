# Meet the Contenders

## 1. Salesforce CPQ (Old, but Tried and True)

Salesforce CPQ is a native tool that integrates seamlessly with the Salesforce ecosystem. It provides robust features for creating complex quotes, automating discount approvals, and managing subscription renewals. Notably, Salesforce CPQ has been around for a long time, even before it became a Salesforce product. While it boasts an extensive set of features, it often receives criticism for its outdated user interface.

- **Speed of Setup:** Since it's a native Salesforce product, the implementation is relatively straightforward compared to non-native solutions.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Regular updates and seamless integration with other Salesforce products make ongoing maintenance simpler.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Direct integration with Salesforce CRM and other native applications without requiring middleware.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for companies of all sizes, but may require customization for more complex scenarios.

**Use Case:** Ideal for businesses with straightforward pricing models and a strong reliance on Salesforce CRM. Works well for companies looking to scale their subscription business or manage complex product configurations.

## 2. Salesforce NEW Revenue Cloud, aka "RLM" (Beta, the Successor with Growing Pains)

Revenue Cloud is an evolution of Salesforce CPQ, combining CPQ and billing functionalities into one unified platform. Itâ€™s designed for businesses looking to streamline their entire revenue lifecycle. As a spiritual successor to Salesforce CPQ, it features an updated interface and an API-first design structure, maintaining the same data configuration usage as CPQ (but completely different data model). Although it promises easier maintenance over time, its implementation can be more challenging. Currently, it is still in beta, so we should expect further updates to enhance its limited feature set.

- **Ease of Maintenance:** Consolidating CPQ and billing reduces the need for complex integrations and maintenance efforts, but is not a fit for all businesses.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Enhanced integration with ERP systems and improved data visibility across the revenue lifecycle.
- **Scalability:** Scales well for subscription-based and usage-based billing models.

**Use Case:** Best for businesses with revenue recognition needs, such as those offering a mix of subscriptions, usage-based pricing, and one-time sales.

## 3. Apttus CPQ, aka "Conga CPQ" (Strong Alternative to Salesforce Products)

Apttus CPQ, now part of the Conga Suite, is a robust, enterprise-grade CPQ solution known for its advanced configurability and flexibility. Its unique billing-first approach allows for a unified pricing experience between invoices and quotes when using both its CPQ and billing tools. This makes it particularly appealing for organizations that prioritize consistent pricing across the entire revenue cycle.

- **Speed of Setup:** Longer setup times due to the high degree of customization available.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Requires a dedicated team to manage and maintain due to its complexity.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Strong integration capabilities, but often requires additional middleware or integration platforms.
- **Scalability:** Excellent for large enterprises with complex pricing, but can be overkill for smaller businesses.

**Use Case:** Suitable for large enterprises with complex products and pricing rules, particularly in industries like manufacturing and technology.

## 4. Zuora CPQ (Ideal for Zuora Billing Users)

Zuora CPQ is designed specifically for subscription-based businesses, offering advanced billing and revenue recognition features. It is part of the Zuora suite, which focuses on subscription management.

- **Speed of Setup:** Faster for subscription-based businesses that already use Zuora for billing.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Integrated billing and subscription management reduce the need for extensive customization.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Excellent integration with other Zuora products and Salesforce but may require middleware for non-native systems.
- **Scalability:** Scales well for subscription-based businesses but may not be ideal for businesses with mixed revenue models.

**Use Case:** Ideal for companies that are heavily focused on subscription revenue, especially those that already use the Zuora billing platform.

## 5. Custom CPQ Solutions (Tailor-Fit Solutions)

Custom CPQ solutions can be built directly on Salesforce or integrated using middleware. This approach offers maximum flexibility but comes with higher development and maintenance costs.

- **Speed of Setup:** Highly variable; initial setup time can be long, but it is tailored exactly to business needs.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Maintenance complexity depends on the quality of the initial build and documentation.
- **Integration Capabilities:** Can be integrated with virtually any system, but requires significant development effort.
- **Scalability:** Highly scalable, but ongoing costs can escalate as the business grows and requirements evolve.

**Use Case:** Best for organizations with unique requirements that cannot be met by out-of-the-box solutions or those that need to integrate with multiple systems outside of the Salesforce ecosystem.

## Subscription Sales vs. One-Time Sales

### Subscription Sales Scenarios

- Salesforce Revenue Cloud and Zuora CPQ are the strongest contenders, given their focus on subscription management, billing, and revenue recognition.
- Custom solutions may be necessary if there are highly unique subscription models or complex integrations with external billing systems.

### One-Time Sales Scenarios

- Salesforce CPQ or Apttus CPQ are better suited for businesses focused on one-time sales or complex product configurations.
- Custom CPQ solutions can also be a good fit if your sales process involves intricate workflows or heavy integration with external systems.

## Current Trends in CPQ

- **AI-Driven Pricing and Recommendations:** Many CPQ solutions now incorporate AI to provide pricing guidance based on historical data, improving deal velocity and margin optimization.
- **Automation and Self-Service:** CPQ tools are increasingly focusing on self-service capabilities, enabling customers to configure and price products themselves, reducing the burden on sales teams.
- **Integrated Revenue Management:** Tools like Salesforce Revenue Cloud are expanding beyond traditional CPQ functionalities to encompass the entire revenue lifecycle, from quote to cash.

## Conclusion

There are many CPQ solutions on the market, and the right choice depends on your business model, complexity of pricing, and integration requirements. Salesforce Revenue Cloud and Zuora CPQ are strong options for subscription-based businesses, while Salesforce CPQ and Apttus CPQ excel in more traditional, product-centric sales environments. Custom solutions, while resource-intensive, provide unmatched flexibility for businesses with unique needs.

By carefully evaluating these options based on speed of setup, ease of maintenance, integration capabilities, and scalability, you can choose the CPQ solution that will best support your sales and revenue goals.
