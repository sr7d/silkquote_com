# SilkQuote — Complete Product Reference

> Professional PDF quote generation for Salesforce. Free, no-code configurator for admins, one-click generation for reps.

## Overview

SilkQuote is a native Salesforce application (Lightning component) that transforms Opportunities into professional, branded PDF quotes. Built for Salesforce admins and sales teams, it replaces complex CPQ implementations with a simple, free tool that works with Professional Edition and above.

SilkQuote is installed from the Salesforce AppExchange and runs entirely within Salesforce — no external systems, no data exports, no per-user licensing fees.

## How It Works

SilkQuote follows a three-step process:

1. **Build Templates** — Admins configure flexible templates directly in Salesforce with a drag-and-drop interface. Templates support dynamic fields, conditional sections, and standardized terms & conditions — all without code.

2. **Generate Quotes** — Sales reps generate polished PDF quotes with one click. Products, pricing, and customer details are pulled in automatically from Opportunities, Accounts, Quotes, and custom objects with zero manual effort.

3. **Share & Close** — Share quotes via email, secure link, or integrated e-signature. Preview before sending, save to Salesforce, and keep the sales cycle moving fast.

- Need professional, branded PDF quotes from Salesforce
- Follow a process like: Opportunity → Quote PDF → E-Signature → Order & Invoice
- Want to be live in days, not months
- Value simplicity, automation, and high user adoption

SilkQuote is NOT a fit if you:

## Comparison Summary

**vs. Out-of-the-Box Salesforce Quotes:** SilkQuote provides professional branded PDFs, Flow automation, and customizable templates. Standard Salesforce quotes offer basic formatting that is hard to brand and no automation.

**vs. Traditional CPQ (Salesforce CPQ, etc.):** SilkQuote is free, installs in days, works with Professional Edition, and any admin can manage it. Traditional CPQ costs significantly more, takes months to implement, typically requires Enterprise+, and needs specialist consultants.

**vs. Conga Composer / S-Docs:** SilkQuote is purpose-built for quote generation with a visual configurator, while Conga and S-Docs are general-purpose document generation tools that require more setup for quoting use cases.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is SilkQuote really free?**
Yes, 100%. Every feature, unlimited users, no expiration. SilkQuote is supported by expert services for teams who want hands-on setup and customization.

**Can I set it up myself?**
Absolutely. Most teams are sending quotes within an hour. Expert services are available for teams that want a polished, production-ready setup without the trial and error.

**When do teams typically need expert help?**
When you need custom templates, advanced automation, integration services, and ongoing consultative quote-to-cash support.

Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, and Performance editions.
