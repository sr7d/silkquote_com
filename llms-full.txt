# SilkQuote — Complete Product Reference

> Templatize, generate, and share dynamic quotes customers can review and accept. Free, native Salesforce quoting.

## Overview

SilkQuote is a native Salesforce application that speeds up negotiations, reduces approval times, and makes quoting easier. Admins build reusable templates with conditional fields and custom terms. Reps generate professional PDFs in one click. Prospects review, comment on, and accept quotes via a hosted link. All inside Salesforce, at zero cost.

SilkQuote is installed from the Salesforce AppExchange and runs entirely within Salesforce. No external systems, no data exports, no per-user licensing fees.

## How It Works

SilkQuote follows a three-step process:

1. **Templatize** — Admins build reusable, branded templates with conditional fields, custom layouts, and terms and conditions. All without code.

2. **Generate** — Reps generate a dynamic, professional quote PDF in one click or via automation. Product, pricing, and customer details are pulled automatically from Salesforce.

3. **Share and Accept** — Share a hosted quote link customers can review, comment on, and accept. Track when prospects view the quote and keep negotiations moving.

## Comparison Summary

**vs. Out-of-the-Box Salesforce Quotes:** SilkQuote provides professional branded PDFs, Flow automation, and customizable templates. Standard Salesforce quotes offer basic formatting that is hard to brand and no automation.

**vs. Traditional CPQ (Salesforce CPQ, etc.):** SilkQuote is free, installs in days, works with Professional Edition, and any admin can manage it. Traditional CPQ costs significantly more, takes months to implement, typically requires Enterprise+, and needs specialist consultants.

**vs. Conga Composer / S-Docs:** SilkQuote is purpose-built for quote generation with a visual configurator, while Conga and S-Docs are general-purpose document generation tools that require more setup for quoting use cases.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Yes, 100%. Every feature, unlimited users, no expiration. SilkQuote is supported by expert services for teams who want hands-on setup and customization.
