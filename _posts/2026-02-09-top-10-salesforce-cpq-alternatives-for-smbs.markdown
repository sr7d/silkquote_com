Salesforce CPQ has long been the go-to configure-price-quote solution for large enterprises. But for small and mid-size businesses (SMBs), the platform can feel like bringing a bulldozer to a garden party. The licensing costs alone can consume an entire software budget, and that is before factoring in months of implementation work and the ongoing need for specialized admin support.

This guide breaks down the top 10 Salesforce CPQ alternatives for SMBs in 2026, ranked by value, ease of use, and fit for smaller teams that need professional quoting without enterprise-level overhead.

## What is Salesforce CPQ?

Salesforce CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) is a native Salesforce product that automates the quoting process for sales teams. It allows reps to configure complex product bundles, apply pricing rules and discounts, and generate quote documents directly within Salesforce.

CPQ is powerful. It handles multi-tier pricing, subscription billing logic, approval workflows, and guided selling. For organizations with hundreds of SKUs, layered discount structures, and complex revenue recognition needs, it is an indispensable tool.

However, that power comes at a price. Salesforce CPQ licenses start at $75 per user per month (billed annually), and most organizations require the CPQ Plus tier at $150 per user per month to access the features they actually need. Implementation projects routinely run six to twelve months, often requiring certified CPQ consultants at premium rates.

## Why SMBs Look for Alternatives

Small and mid-size businesses face a distinct set of challenges that make Salesforce CPQ a difficult fit:

**Cost is prohibitive.** A ten-person sales team on CPQ Plus runs $18,000 per year in licensing alone. Add implementation consulting, and the first-year cost can easily exceed $50,000. For an SMB, that budget could fund an entire department.

**Complexity exceeds the need.** Most SMBs do not have hundreds of product configurations or multi-level approval chains. They need clean, branded quotes generated quickly from Opportunity data. CPQ's depth becomes a burden when 80% of its features go unused.

**Implementation timelines are too long.** SMBs move fast. A six-month implementation cycle means missed quarters and frustrated sales teams. Smaller organizations need tools that deliver value in days or weeks, not months.

**Ongoing maintenance is demanding.** CPQ requires dedicated admin attention. Price rules, product bundles, and quote templates need continuous tuning. Without a full-time Salesforce admin who understands CPQ's data model, configurations drift and break.

**The learning curve is steep.** Training sales reps on CPQ takes time. For lean teams where every hour counts, a simpler tool that reps can learn in a single session holds real appeal.

For these reasons, many Salesforce admins at SMBs search for a Salesforce CPQ alternative that fits their budget and operational reality. The good news: there are excellent options available.

## Top 10 Salesforce CPQ Alternatives for SMBs

### 1. SilkQuote

**Best for: SMBs that want professional PDF quotes generated natively in Salesforce without any CPQ complexity.**

SilkQuote is a free Salesforce quote tool built as a native Lightning component. It focuses on doing one thing exceptionally well: turning Opportunity and Quote data into polished, branded PDF documents.

SilkQuote offers a drag-and-drop template designer that requires zero coding. Salesforce admins can configure templates with company logos, custom field mappings, conditional sections, terms and conditions, signature blocks, and draft watermarks. Quote generation happens in one click directly from the Opportunity record.

- **Pricing:** Free tier available. No per-user licensing.
- **Installation:** Installs from the AppExchange in minutes. Most admins have their first template running within 30 minutes.
- **Key strengths:** Native Salesforce integration, visual template builder, intelligent field mapping across Opportunities, Accounts, Quotes, and custom objects.
- **Best suited for:** SMBs that need professional quote output without product configuration logic. Teams that want to stop emailing spreadsheets and start sending branded proposals.

SilkQuote does not attempt to replicate CPQ's product configuration or pricing engine. Instead, it fills the gap that most SMBs actually experience: the need for a fast, professional, and repeatable way to generate quote documents from existing Salesforce data.

### 2. PandaDoc

**Best for: Teams that need document automation beyond just quotes, including proposals, contracts, and e-signatures.**

PandaDoc is a document automation platform with a solid Salesforce integration. It pulls data from Salesforce records into customizable templates and includes built-in e-signature functionality.

- **Pricing:** Starts at $35 per user per month. Free e-signature plan available with limited features.
- **Key strengths:** Broad document types, built-in e-signatures, content library, document analytics.
- **Considerations:** Not a native Salesforce app. Data sync between PandaDoc and Salesforce can require configuration, and some users report occasional latency.

### 3. Proposify

**Best for: Sales teams that want to create visually rich proposals with detailed analytics on recipient engagement.**

Proposify focuses on the proposal experience. Its editor allows sales teams to build visually compelling documents with interactive pricing tables, video embeds, and branded design elements.

- **Pricing:** Starts at $49 per user per month.
- **Key strengths:** Beautiful proposal templates, content analytics (view time, section engagement), interactive pricing tables.
- **Considerations:** Salesforce integration requires setup. The platform lives outside Salesforce, so reps need to switch contexts. Pricing can add up for larger teams.

### 4. Qwilr

**Best for: Modern sales teams that prefer web-based proposals over traditional PDF documents.**

Qwilr creates interactive, web-page-style proposals rather than static PDFs. Recipients view quotes as responsive web pages with embedded video, ROI calculators, and accept-and-pay functionality.

- **Pricing:** Starts at $35 per user per month.
- **Key strengths:** Interactive web-based quotes, modern design, built-in payment acceptance, strong analytics.
- **Considerations:** The web-based format is not ideal for every industry. Some buyers still expect PDF attachments. Salesforce integration is available but not native.

### 5. QuoteWerks

**Best for: SMBs that need product configuration and quoting but cannot justify Salesforce CPQ's price tag.**

QuoteWerks is a dedicated CPQ tool designed for small and mid-size businesses. It offers product configuration, pricing rules, and quote generation at a fraction of CPQ's cost. It integrates with Salesforce through a connector.

- **Pricing:** One-time license starting at $199 per user, or subscription plans from $22 per user per month.
- **Key strengths:** Full CPQ functionality at SMB pricing, integrations with distributors for real-time pricing, strong product database management.
- **Considerations:** Desktop-based application with a dated interface. Not a native Salesforce experience. Requires installation on local machines.

### 6. DealHub

**Best for: Mid-market companies that want CPQ, contract management, and subscription billing in one platform.**

DealHub provides a CPQ solution with guided selling, dynamic pricing, and a digital sales room concept called DealRoom. It integrates with Salesforce and offers a more modern user experience than traditional CPQ tools.

- **Pricing:** Custom pricing based on team size. Generally positioned as more affordable than Salesforce CPQ but still a significant investment.
- **Key strengths:** Guided selling workflows, digital sales rooms, contract lifecycle management, subscription management.
- **Considerations:** Pricing is not transparent. Mid-market focus means it may still be complex for very small teams.

### 7. Conga (formerly Apttus)

**Best for: Organizations that need robust document generation paired with revenue lifecycle management.**

Conga offers a suite of tools spanning CPQ, contract management, and document generation. Its Composer product is widely used for generating documents from Salesforce data.

- **Pricing:** Custom pricing. Typically starts around $30 per user per month for document generation. Full CPQ pricing is higher.
- **Key strengths:** Deep Salesforce integration, mature document generation engine, broad feature set across the revenue lifecycle.
- **Considerations:** The platform has grown through acquisitions, and the user experience can feel fragmented. Implementation can be complex, and costs scale quickly when adding modules.

### 8. Nuvem CPQ (formerly ConnectWise Sell)

**Best for: IT service providers and managed service businesses that need quoting tied to hardware and service catalogs.**

Nuvem CPQ is tailored for technology service providers. It connects to distributor pricing databases, supports hardware and service bundling, and generates professional proposals.

- **Pricing:** Custom pricing. Plans generally start around $30 per user per month.
- **Key strengths:** Real-time distributor pricing, hardware and service bundling, professional proposal output, strong in the IT channel.
- **Considerations:** Industry-specific focus limits its usefulness outside of IT services. Salesforce integration is available but not the primary CRM target.

### 9. Zuora CPQ

**Best for: Subscription-first businesses that need CPQ tightly integrated with billing and revenue recognition.**

Zuora CPQ is designed for subscription and usage-based pricing models. It handles complex subscription changes like upgrades, downgrades, and mid-term amendments natively.

- **Pricing:** Custom pricing based on transaction volume and features.
- **Key strengths:** Subscription lifecycle management, usage-based pricing, revenue recognition, strong billing integration.
- **Considerations:** Overly specialized for businesses with simple one-time pricing. Implementation is not trivial, and costs can rival Salesforce CPQ for smaller deployments.

### 10. HubSpot Quotes

**Best for: Teams already using HubSpot CRM that want basic quoting functionality included in their existing subscription.**

HubSpot includes a native quoting tool within its Sales Hub. It allows reps to generate simple quotes with e-signature support and payment collection.

- **Pricing:** Included with HubSpot Sales Hub (starts at $20 per user per month). Basic quotes available on free CRM plan.
- **Key strengths:** Native to HubSpot, simple setup, built-in e-signatures and payment links, no additional cost for existing users.
- **Considerations:** Not a Salesforce tool. Only relevant for teams considering a CRM switch or running HubSpot alongside Salesforce. Limited customization compared to dedicated quoting tools.

## When to Use an Alternative

Not every organization should abandon Salesforce CPQ. The decision to use a Salesforce CPQ alternative depends on several factors:

**Choose an alternative when:**

- The sales team is under 50 users and product configurations are straightforward.
- The primary need is professional quote document generation, not complex product bundling.
- Budget constraints make CPQ licensing untenable.
- The organization lacks a dedicated Salesforce CPQ admin.
- Implementation needs to happen in days or weeks, not months.
- Sales reps need a tool they can learn in a single training session.

**Stick with Salesforce CPQ when:**

- The product catalog has hundreds of SKUs with complex bundling rules.
- Multi-level discount approvals and pricing governance are critical.
- Subscription billing with mid-term amendments is a core requirement.
- The organization has the budget and internal expertise to support CPQ long-term.
- Guided selling workflows are essential to the sales process.

For many SMBs, the answer is clear. A free Salesforce quote tool like SilkQuote handles the document generation need, while the product and pricing logic stays manageable within standard Salesforce Price Books and Opportunity Products. This combination delivers 90% of the value at a fraction of the cost and complexity.

## Making the Right Choice

The best Salesforce CPQ alternative is the one that matches the actual complexity of the sales process, not the aspirational complexity. SMBs that start with a lightweight tool can always scale up later. But organizations that over-invest in CPQ before they need it often find themselves paying for features they never use while struggling with a system that slows their team down.

For Salesforce admins evaluating options, the recommendation is straightforward: start with the simplest tool that meets the current need. If that need is professional, branded quote documents generated from Salesforce data, SilkQuote is a strong starting point with zero financial risk.
