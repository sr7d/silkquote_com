Salesforce CPQ is the go-to configure-price-quote solution for large enterprises. But for small and mid-size businesses (SMBs), it often feels like overkill. Licensing costs alone can consume an entire software budget, and that is before months of implementation work and the ongoing need for specialized admin support.

This guide ranks the top 10 Salesforce CPQ alternatives for SMBs in 2026 by value, ease of use, and fit for smaller teams that need professional quoting without enterprise overhead.

## What is Salesforce CPQ?

Salesforce CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) automates the quoting process for sales teams. Reps can configure complex product bundles, apply pricing rules and discounts, and generate quote documents directly within Salesforce.

CPQ is powerful. It handles multi-tier pricing, subscription billing logic, approval workflows, and guided selling. For organizations with hundreds of SKUs, layered discount structures, and complex revenue recognition needs, it is indispensable.

That power comes at a price. Licenses start at $75 per user per month (billed annually), and most organizations need the CPQ Plus tier at $150 per user per month. Implementation projects run six to twelve months and often require certified CPQ consultants at premium rates.

## Why SMBs Look for Alternatives

Small and mid-size businesses face challenges that make Salesforce CPQ a difficult fit:

**Cost is prohibitive.** A ten-person sales team on CPQ Plus runs $18,000 per year in licensing alone. Add implementation consulting, and the first-year cost can exceed $50,000. For an SMB, that budget could fund an entire department.

**Complexity exceeds the need.** Most SMBs do not have hundreds of product configurations or multi-level approval chains. They need clean, branded quotes generated quickly from Opportunity data. When 80% of CPQ's features go unused, the depth becomes a burden.

**Implementation takes too long.** SMBs move fast. A six-month implementation cycle means missed quarters and frustrated sales teams. Smaller organizations need tools that deliver value in days or weeks, not months.

**Maintenance is demanding.** CPQ requires dedicated admin attention. Price rules, product bundles, and quote templates need continuous tuning. Without a full-time Salesforce admin who understands CPQ's data model, configurations drift and break.

**The learning curve is steep.** Training sales reps on CPQ takes time. For lean teams where every hour counts, a simpler tool that reps can learn in one session holds real appeal.

Many Salesforce admins at SMBs search for a CPQ alternative that fits their budget and operational reality. The good news: excellent options exist.

## Top 10 Salesforce CPQ Alternatives for SMBs

### 1. SilkQuote

**Best for: SMBs that want professional PDF quotes generated natively in Salesforce without CPQ complexity.**

SilkQuote is a free, native Lightning component built for one job: turning Opportunity and Quote data into polished, branded PDF documents.

Its drag-and-drop template designer requires zero coding. Admins can configure templates with company logos, custom field mappings, conditional sections, terms and conditions, signature blocks, and draft watermarks. Reps generate quotes in one click from the Opportunity record.

- **Pricing:** Free tier available. No per-user licensing.
- **Installation:** Installs from the AppExchange in minutes. Most admins have their first template running within 30 minutes.
- **Key strengths:** Native Salesforce integration, visual template builder, intelligent field mapping across Opportunities, Accounts, Quotes, and custom objects.
- **Best suited for:** SMBs that need professional quote output without product configuration logic. Teams ready to stop emailing spreadsheets and start sending branded proposals.

SilkQuote does not replicate CPQ's product configuration or pricing engine. Instead, it fills the gap most SMBs face: the need for a fast, repeatable way to generate quote documents from existing Salesforce data.

### 2. PandaDoc

**Best for: Teams that need document automation beyond quotes, including proposals, contracts, and e-signatures.**

PandaDoc is a document automation platform with a solid Salesforce integration. It pulls data from Salesforce records into customizable templates and includes built-in e-signature functionality.

- **Pricing:** Starts at $35 per user per month. Free e-signature plan available with limited features.
- **Key strengths:** Broad document types, built-in e-signatures, content library, document analytics.
- **Considerations:** Not a native Salesforce app. Data sync between PandaDoc and Salesforce can require configuration, and some users report occasional latency.

### 3. Proposify

**Best for: Sales teams that want visually rich proposals with detailed engagement analytics.**

Proposify focuses on the proposal experience. Its editor lets teams build compelling documents with interactive pricing tables, video embeds, and branded design elements.

- **Pricing:** Starts at $49 per user per month.
- **Key strengths:** Beautiful proposal templates, content analytics (view time, section engagement), interactive pricing tables.
- **Considerations:** Salesforce integration requires setup. The platform lives outside Salesforce, so reps switch contexts. Pricing adds up for larger teams.

### 4. Qwilr

**Best for: Sales teams that prefer web-based proposals over traditional PDFs.**

Qwilr creates interactive, web-page-style proposals instead of static PDFs. Recipients view quotes as responsive web pages with embedded video, ROI calculators, and accept-and-pay functionality.

- **Pricing:** Starts at $35 per user per month.
- **Key strengths:** Interactive web-based quotes, modern design, built-in payment acceptance, strong analytics.
- **Considerations:** The web-based format does not suit every industry. Some buyers still expect PDF attachments. Salesforce integration is available but not native.

### 5. QuoteWerks

**Best for: SMBs that need product configuration and quoting but cannot justify CPQ's price tag.**

QuoteWerks is a dedicated CPQ tool designed for small and mid-size businesses. It offers product configuration, pricing rules, and quote generation at a fraction of CPQ's cost, integrating with Salesforce through a connector.

- **Pricing:** One-time license starting at $199 per user, or subscription plans from $22 per user per month.
- **Key strengths:** Full CPQ functionality at SMB pricing, distributor integrations for real-time pricing, strong product database management.
- **Considerations:** Desktop-based application with a dated interface. Not a native Salesforce experience. Requires local installation.

### 6. DealHub

**Best for: Mid-market companies that want CPQ, contract management, and subscription billing in one platform.**

DealHub provides CPQ with guided selling, dynamic pricing, and a digital sales room concept called DealRoom. It integrates with Salesforce and offers a more modern experience than traditional CPQ tools.

- **Pricing:** Custom pricing based on team size. Generally more affordable than Salesforce CPQ but still a significant investment.
- **Key strengths:** Guided selling workflows, digital sales rooms, contract lifecycle management, subscription management.
- **Considerations:** Pricing is not transparent. Mid-market focus means it may still be complex for very small teams.

### 7. Conga (formerly Apttus)

**Best for: Organizations that need robust document generation paired with revenue lifecycle management.**

Conga offers tools spanning CPQ, contract management, and document generation. Its Composer product is widely used for generating documents from Salesforce data.

- **Pricing:** Custom pricing. Typically starts around $30 per user per month for document generation. Full CPQ pricing is higher.
- **Key strengths:** Deep Salesforce integration, mature document generation engine, broad feature set across the revenue lifecycle.
- **Considerations:** The platform has grown through acquisitions, and the user experience can feel fragmented. Implementation can be complex, and costs scale quickly when adding modules.

### 8. Nuvem CPQ (formerly ConnectWise Sell)

**Best for: IT service providers and managed service businesses that need quoting tied to hardware and service catalogs.**

Nuvem CPQ is tailored for technology service providers. It connects to distributor pricing databases, supports hardware and service bundling, and generates professional proposals.

- **Pricing:** Custom pricing. Plans generally start around $30 per user per month.
- **Key strengths:** Real-time distributor pricing, hardware and service bundling, professional proposal output, strong in the IT channel.
- **Considerations:** Industry-specific focus limits usefulness outside IT services. Salesforce integration is available but not the primary CRM target.

### 9. Zuora CPQ

**Best for: Subscription-first businesses that need CPQ tightly integrated with billing and revenue recognition.**

Zuora CPQ handles subscription and usage-based pricing models. It manages complex subscription changes like upgrades, downgrades, and mid-term amendments natively.

- **Pricing:** Custom pricing based on transaction volume and features.
- **Key strengths:** Subscription lifecycle management, usage-based pricing, revenue recognition, strong billing integration.
- **Considerations:** Too specialized for businesses with simple one-time pricing. Implementation is not trivial, and costs can rival Salesforce CPQ for smaller deployments.

### 10. HubSpot Quotes

**Best for: Teams already on HubSpot CRM that want basic quoting included in their existing subscription.**

HubSpot includes a native quoting tool within its Sales Hub. Reps can generate simple quotes with e-signature support and payment collection.

- **Pricing:** Included with HubSpot Sales Hub (starts at $20 per user per month). Basic quotes available on the free CRM plan.
- **Key strengths:** Native to HubSpot, simple setup, built-in e-signatures and payment links, no extra cost for existing users.
- **Considerations:** Not a Salesforce tool. Only relevant for teams considering a CRM switch or running HubSpot alongside Salesforce. Limited customization compared to dedicated quoting tools.

## When to Use an Alternative

Not every organization should leave Salesforce CPQ. The right choice depends on several factors.

**Choose an alternative when:**

- The sales team is under 50 users and product configurations are straightforward.
- The primary need is professional quote documents, not complex product bundling.
- Budget constraints make CPQ licensing untenable.
- The organization lacks a dedicated CPQ admin.
- Implementation needs to happen in days or weeks, not months.
- Reps need a tool they can learn in a single training session.

**Stick with Salesforce CPQ when:**

- The product catalog has hundreds of SKUs with complex bundling rules.
- Multi-level discount approvals and pricing governance are critical.
- Subscription billing with mid-term amendments is a core requirement.
- The organization has the budget and expertise to support CPQ long-term.
- Guided selling workflows are essential to the sales process.

For many SMBs, the answer is clear. A free tool like SilkQuote handles document generation, while product and pricing logic stays manageable within standard Salesforce Price Books and Opportunity Products. This combination delivers 90% of the value at a fraction of the cost and complexity.

## Making the Right Choice

The best Salesforce CPQ alternative matches the actual complexity of the sales process, not the aspirational complexity. SMBs that start with a lightweight tool can always scale up later. Organizations that over-invest in CPQ before they need it often pay for features they never use while struggling with a system that slows their team down.

For Salesforce admins evaluating options, the recommendation is straightforward: start with the simplest tool that meets the current need. If that need is professional, branded quote documents from Salesforce data, SilkQuote is a strong starting point with zero financial risk.
